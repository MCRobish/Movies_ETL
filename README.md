# Movies_ETL

## Description: 
The purpose of the files in this repository was to take data from Wikipedia and from Kaggle (movie database) and clean the data up to reduce the amount of columns. Several columns were also reformatted to have consistent datatypes. These sources were then merged into two large dataframes, and loaded into an SQL database.
